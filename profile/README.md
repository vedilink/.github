Vedilink is home to academic community for learners, students and professors, to collaborate, learn, and grow. Whether you’re building your first project or sending a Rover to Mars, there’s room for you here.

### An interconnected community

The academic community is the 💗 of Vedilink and fundamental to how we connect _links_ together. Quick-fire question round,

- Why are we building Vedilink? To let you find your tribe and connect with learners and educators all over the world. 🌍
- Who are we? A team of three [musketeers](https://about.vedilink.com/). :woozy_face:	:exploding_head:	:partying_face:	
- What do we do? We build bridges. :bridge_at_night:

Now that we are talking about the important things, have you joined our family? Obviously, right? If not, we can help you get started! Learn more about how to [join the student's network](https://vedilink.com/).
